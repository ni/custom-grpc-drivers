## Introduction

The Custom gRPC Drivers package offers NI gRPC Device Server interface APIs for NI-Switch and NI-DAQmx drivers in LabVIEW. These APIs facilitate efficient communication between LabVIEW applications and hardware devices using the gRPC protocol, enabling session sharing across LabVIEW Measurement Plug-ins.
